This repository contains the codes and network files used in the manuscript titled: A multi-level formalism to capture the characteristics of hybrid phenotypes in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity. 

The "TopoFiles" folder has multiple network files, out of which the results corresponding to "EMT_RACIPE2_noPeri.topo" (23N90E) and "EMT_RACIPE2.topo" (26N100E) are presented in the manuscript. 

The "Codes" folder contains all the codes required to simulate and analyze the networks. A prerequisite is a system environment variable "BMODEL" that points to the folder containing the simulation code. The simulation code can be downloaded from https://github.com/askhari139/Boolean.jl
